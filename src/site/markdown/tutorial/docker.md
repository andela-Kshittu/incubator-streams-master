## Set up a local environment to run streams

Streams components can be embedded in a variety of data processing frameworks based on the problem and performance requirements at hand.

A great way to get started collecting and indexing data is with streams-runtime-local and Docker.

Several example streams are available from docker hub for tutorial purposes.

### Confirm Docker is healthy

We'll assume you've got docker up and running.

Run from your command line:

    docker ps

If you see a (possibly empty) list of running containers, you are good.
